## Styling

This site uses the Simple.css framework via CDN for base styles:

- CDN: <https://cdn.simplecss.org/simple.css>

The repository also includes a local `css/styles.css` file for project-specific overrides. Local styles are loaded after the CDN so you can customize colors, spacing, and small layout changes without modifying the CDN file.
