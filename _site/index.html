      <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>TVI (Text and Visual Information) Resources is built for teachers — especially those early in their careers — who want straightforward, ready-to-use materials for students who are blind or visually impaired. If you’re wondering where to find practical classroom aids, sample lessons, tactile graphics, or scripts to generate accessible materials, this site pulls those resources together in one place.</p>

<p>We focus on low-cost, high-impact options: printable templates, 3D-printable tactile objects, step-by-step classroom instructions, and simple scripts you can run with minimal setup. The goal is to save you prep time and give you tools that actually work in busy classrooms, not research papers or expensive commercial products.</p>

<h2 id="why-open-source-resources">Why Open Source Resources?</h2>

<p>Open, shared resources make it easier for teachers to adapt, reuse, and improve classroom materials. We know many teachers can’t afford specialized commercial equipment, so this collection prioritizes items you can print, build, or repurpose affordably.</p>

<p>When educators share tools and examples, we all benefit — you gain tested ideas you can use tomorrow, and others gain from your real-world feedback. If you try a resource here, please add a short note to its page about how it worked in your classroom (what students liked, what to change). Those short, practical reports help other teachers make quick decisions.</p>
